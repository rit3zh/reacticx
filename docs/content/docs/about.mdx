      Reactix is an open-source React Native UI library built for developers who
      want beautiful, production-ready components without the complexity.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

## The Origin Story

<div className="not-prose">
  <p className="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Reactix started in <strong>January 2025</strong> as a personal project born
    out of necessity. While building React Native apps, I found myself spending
    more time on UI polish than on actual features.
  </p>
  <p className="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
    Creating smooth animations, balanced layouts, and subtle interactions felt
    unnecessarily difficult. The tools existed, but putting them together in a
    way that looked and felt professional was a constant challenge.
  </p>

## The Solution

<div className="not-prose mb-6">
  <p className="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Reactix was created to solve these problems. I started collecting the
    components that were most time-consuming to build, refined them, and made
    them easy to use.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="not-prose my-6">
  <div className="rounded-xl border border-white/10 bg-gradient-to-br from-white/5 to-transparent p-6">
    <blockquote className="border-l-2 border-white/20 pl-4 text-neutral-300">
      "Every component in Reactix represents a problem I faced. The goal is
      simple: provide copy-and-paste ready code that actually works in
      production."
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>

### What Makes Reactix Different

- **Copy & Paste** — No package installation required. Just copy the code you need.
- **Transparent Code** — Readable, modifiable components you can learn from and customize.
- **Mobile First** — Built with gestures, transitions, and touch feedback in mind.
- **Production Ready** — Powered by React Native Reanimated and Skia for smooth 60fps animations.

## Built for Mobile

<div className="not-prose mb-6">
  <p className="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
    Reactix is a mobile-first library, created by someone who thinks in gestures
    and motion. Every component is designed with touch interactions and mobile
    performance as the priority.
  </p>
</div>

## The Goal

<div className="not-prose mt-6">
  <div className="rounded-xl border border-white/10 bg-neutral-950 p-6">
    <p className="mb-4 text-neutral-300">
      Reactix exists to help developers build better mobile apps faster. If it
      saves you time or helps you learn something new, then it's doing its job.
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm text-neutral-500">
      This project is open source because good tools should be accessible to
      everyone.
