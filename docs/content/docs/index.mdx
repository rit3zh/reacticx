## Overview

Reacticx is a headless, animation-focused component library for React Native.
It does **not** rely on external styling systems and is designed to integrate cleanly into existing projects.

---

## 1. Install Required Utilities

Some components depend on shared native utilities that must be installed once.

```package-install
react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-svg expo-haptics expo-blur expo-symbols @expo/vector-icons @shopify/react-native-skia
```

Additional dependencies are listed on individual component pages when required.

---

## 2. Initialize Reacticx

<Card title="Note: The `components.json` file is optional">
  It is only required if you're using the CLI to add components to your project.
  If you're using the copy and paste method, you pretty much don't need this
  file.
</Card>
Run the init command to create your config file:

```bash
npx reacticx init
```

This creates a `component.config.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "outDir": "src/shared/ui"
}
```

---

## 3. Browse Components

List all available components:

```bash
npx reacticx list
```

Filter by category:

```bash
npx reacticx list -c molecules
```

Example output:

```
📦 Reacticx UI Components (v1.0.0)

Total: 50 components

atoms/
  button
  input
  text

molecules/
  accordion
  card
  modal

micro-interactions/
  gooey-switch
  spin-button
```

---

## 4. Add Components

Add a component to your project:

```bash
npx reacticx add button
```

Output:

```
✔ Added button!

Files created:
  src/shared/ui/atoms/button/index.tsx
  src/shared/ui/atoms/button/types.ts
```

### Options

```bash
npx reacticx add <component> --dir <path>
npx reacticx add <component> --overwrite
```
