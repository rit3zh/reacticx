Wrapped in pale shreds of clothing, caked in tan grit and burnt red by the oppressive sun, he was all but a part of the desert already. Anubis, crouched in the shade of a rocky outcrop, panted his jackal tongue in an effort to cool himself. The heat of the clear day was extreme, the weight of its pressure, unrelenting. He pressed as much of his bare skin against the rocks as possible, his fingers spread wide against the sand-smoothed surface, all in an attempt to absorb their stored shade. Unlike his prey, he had come prepared, and lapped greedily at the water from one of the many skins hung from his belt. It was not a day he would have chosen to enter the shifting sands. He sighed and shook his head. The man’s persistent stumbling had taken him out of view over the next rise. Reluctantly, Anubis stood. He took up his long, curved spear, and set out into the sun to continue the pursuit. His endless trailing of the single soul was growing tiresome. As soon as he left the shelter of the rocks and felt the sting of the suns rays upon his bare skin yet again, he made a snap decision. It was time to speed things up.Anubis strode on long legs across the dunes, consuming the distance between him and his prey quickly. The god towered over any human, and found his height most useful. Looking down on the creatures from on high made it far easier to convince them of his power, and that they should accompany him. It was the hardest part, making them see it was time. He wore a linen kilt, sandals and was bare chested but for an ornate collar. It was deep enough to cover well below his shoulders, and rattled with jewelled decorations that hung from its intricate embroidery. A hood covered the back of his neck, hanging like a weight from his pointed ears. The short fur of his head chafed against both. It was far from comfortable, but he was on official business, and needed to look the part. So he walked on, enduring both his clothing and the assault of the sun, confident that the ordeal would soon be over.

 

By noon, Anubis had caught up to the man. The weakling had fallen again. He approached in a way that cast his shadow long over the back of the poor soul, who trembled there on his hands and knees. As intended, his target looked up to see the canine features of his dark outline against the sand. The sight of which forced his shoulders to sag in defeat. Dramatics were key.

“But I’m not done yet…” He whispered.

“I would not be here, if that were true,” Anubis said, extending an open hand.

To his dismay, the dying man turned and swatted his long, clawed fingers away and pushed himself to his feet.

“No.” He croaked, and began walking again in earnest. Swaying much less than before.

Anubis held still for a moment. His nose twitching, his lip curling in outrage. He could understand the reluctance of some humans - the young, the unexpectedly injured or the rapidly sick. But this? It was clear cut. Why fight it?

“Look around!” He snarled, “What chance do you have?”

“A better one than if I go with you!” The man said, not wasting the energy to turn his head.

Anubis stalked forward on long, fast strides, kicking up hot sand and sliding into the man's path. His teeth were bared as he barked,

“Give it up, human! You time is done. Come with me to Osiris, be weighed and end this misery!”

“I told you.” The fool coughed over split and scabbed lips, “I’m not done yet.”

He ducked past the jackal-headed God, and kept walking into the endless dunes. He held his head high, somehow stronger for his defiance. Anubis remained, still staring into the empty space, and clamping his hands tightly around his spear. He twisted his grip back and forth, digging his claws into the wooden handle and scoring the ornate markings. Canine curses to Amun-Ra rumbled in his throat. Why did his task always have to be filled with such difficulty. Why rule that the humans needed to give permission to have their souls ferried from the mortal realm. It was ludicrous.
